*Around DH* revisits the goals of the 2014 project [Around DH in 80 Days](http://arounddh.elotroalex.com/), in order to introduce new and veteran audiences to the global field of DH scholarly practice by engaging with current DH projects from around the world. 

*Around DH in 80 Days* was pathbreaking in its work to raise awareness of the existence of DH around the globe. Close to a decade has passed, and the existence of that DH work is no longer in question. 

Through *Around DH* we hope to take the next step: surfacing the networks of people and sources behind these projects, the tools used, and what these projects mean. What does the project team hope to accomplish with this work? What have they learned in the process? Each piece is written by someone associated with the project, responding in their own words to questions posed by *Around DH*.

*Around DH* is coordinated by Quinn Dombrowski and Paul Spence.
